=======

MusePHP is a project for Integration-Layer Services by PHP.
Juse like Spray.io in scala think, we think integartion-layer is important in real world.

Muse approachs the integration layer is as Collection of Micro-Services, and so we focused on 
"How to simplify attach/detach of the services by both 'Business Requirements' and 'Resource Limitation'."
